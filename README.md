# [gulp](http://gulpjs.com)-revsolve

Resolves asset references to absolute paths. Revisioned assets processed
by [gulp-rev](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-rev) can be replaced as well.

This plugin is based on awesome [gulp-revplace](https://github.com/tenphi/gulp-revplace) by [Andrey Yamanov](https://github.com/tenphi).
It removes dependency on [mmmagic](https://github.com/mscdex/mmmagic) which caused problems with installation.
In contrast to [gulp-revplace](https://github.com/tenphi/gulp-revplace) this plugin provides more grained control over
assets with additional options.

_Note_: Use {read: false} option with gulp.src for files that don't require content processing.

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev gulp-revsolve
```

## Usage

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var base = 'somedir';

gulp.task('default', function () {
  var
    revsolve = require('gulp-revsolve'),
    es = require('event-stream');

  return es.merge(
    gulp
      .src([base + '/index.html'], { base: base }),
    gulp
      .src([base + '/*/**/*.*'], { base: base })
      .pipe(rev())
  )
    .pipe(revsolve())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('somedir'));
});
```

Check [gulp-revplace](https://github.com/tenphi/gulp-revplace) documentation
for additional info.
